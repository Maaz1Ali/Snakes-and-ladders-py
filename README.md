🎲 Snakes and Ladders – Python Game

A terminal-based Snakes and Ladders game implemented in Python.
The project focuses on game logic, turn-based flow, and clean modular design, making it a strong beginner-to-intermediate level Python project.

📌 Features

🎮 User vs Computer gameplay

🎲 Dice-based movement

🐍 Snake logic (position decreases)

🪜 Ladder logic (position increases)

🔁 Turn-based system

🧠 Clean and readable game logic

🧩 Modular function-based design

🖥️ Fully terminal-based interaction

🧠 Game Rules

The board has positions from 1 to 100

Players roll a dice (1–6) on their turn

Landing on a:

🐍 Snake moves the player down

🪜 Ladder moves the player up


A player must land exactly on 100 to win

Turns alternate between User and Computer

First player to reach position 100 wins
